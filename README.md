# Description
This Excel app helps you refine the conditions of your NECEEM experiments to ensure accuracy. Based on data from a preliminary experiment, it tries to validate your experiments based on a set of quality criteria. If your experiment does not pass the validation test, the program provides recomendations on how to improve it. 

It is highly recommended that you read the associated [article](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02882) before using this program. 

This version is developed for analysis of data obtained by a P/ACE MDQ series of Capillary Electrophoresis instruments (Beckman-Coulter, Sciex), and exported by 32 Karat software, versions 7-9. The program has been written using Visual Basic, and requires Microsoft Excel version 2010 or later. 

Please make sure that you have macros enabled for this sheet. See the Troubleshooting section at the end of this document for more details.
